To quote from Pritchard (2011)

> The study site for this thesis was the Huriawa Peninsula (45° 38' 20.58" S, 170° 40' 19.38" E), 28 km north of Dunedin on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The site is wave-exposed, and strongly affected by both northeast and southerly swells, the two dominant swell directions along this coast (pers. obs.). The peninsula also sits near the mouth of the Waikouaiti River, approximately 800 m from this study site. The subtidal substrate surrounding the peninsula consists of large boulders and rocky reef, interspersed with small patches of coarse sand. The two depth strata used were 2 m and 10 m below mean sea level (Figure 1.02). At the 2 m site, the community was dominated by large fucoids including *Marginariella boryana*, *Carpophyllum flexuosum*, *Cystophora retroflexa* and the laminarian kelp *Macrocystis pyrifera* (Richards, 2009; Hepburn et al., 2011). Occasionally *Anotrichium crinitum* can be found in this shallow site although it is usually found growing epiphytically on *Cystophora spp* and not attached to the rock substrate (pers. obs.). The 10 m site is located on the seaward edge of a large *Macrocystis pyrifera* kelp forest. The brown macroalga *Halopteris novae-zelandiae* and the laminarian kelp *Ecklonia radiata* can be found at this depth, however the community is dominated by crustose coralline macroalgae and small tufting rhodophytes, including A. crinitum (Hepburn et al., 2011).
