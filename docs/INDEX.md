# Location

This repository includes [basic GIS information][GIS]. To quote from Pritchard (2011):

> The study site for this thesis was the Huriawa Peninsula (45° 38' 20.58" S, 170° 40' 19.38" E), 28 km north of Dunedin on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The site is wave-exposed, and strongly affected by both northeast and southerly swells, the two dominant swell directions along this coast (pers. obs.). The peninsula also sits near the mouth of the Waikouaiti River, approximately 800 m from this study site. 

# Methods

Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at the Huriawa Peninsula at 2 m and 10 m was recorded using a logging sensor (Odyssey, Dataflow Systems Pty Ltd, Christchurch, New Zealand) calibrated before each deployment against a LI-COR Quantum Sensor (LI-190, LI-COR Inc., Nebraska, USA). 

Using SCUBA, a 30 cm long aluminium stake was driven into a crack between boulders and fixed in place using underwater epoxy (Expocrete UA, Fosroc, Petone, New Zealand). The logger was attached to the stake using cable ties and stainless-steel hose clamps, positioned with the sensor parallel to the surface and protruding above the stake to prevent shading from the mooring system. 

PAR (µmol photons m-2 s-1) was recorded every five minutes.
